				  <!-- Source for Mancala https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala -->
				  <p>Mancala is a game played with two apponents. The player who takes the most stones, balls or marbles from the other player is the winner.
					Mancala is a game of strategy. You also may have to risk some of your pieces to get more from your apponent.
					There are physical and virtual ways to play the game.

				<div id="panel2">
					<h2><img src="img/spheres.jpeg" style="float:right" height="150" alt="robot">Spheres for panel 2</h2>
				  <p>Spheres is a game I came up with while hosting a small party. The games constist of 48 round soft stress balls. The balls are stacked during the game, 
					based on sets of 3. The game is played with three apponents in turn. Questions are asked and whomever gets the correct answer earns a turn to place there sphere.
					The idea is to get all your balls stacked; without being blocked by the other two players.

					<h2><img src="img/dog.jpeg" style="float:right" height="150" alt="robot">Train the Dog for panel 3</h2>
				  <p>Aibo is an A.I Robot dog. His lifecycle is from puppy to adult. He has to be trained ofcourse. You train Aibo by spending time wiith him and playing with him. 
					Sunny is my dogs name. See him in the photo. He is still not potty trained. When he lifts his leg; I have to tap him on the tail and say no or bad dog.
					He also crys when its time for bed. I place him in his bed and tell him to stay. We are still working on that as well.
					Feel free to learn more about Aibo about here: <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'"><a href="https://us.aibo.com/">More Info</a></button>
